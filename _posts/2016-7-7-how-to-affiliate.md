<h1>Planning</h1>
		<h2>Choosing a niche</h2>
		<p>Anything can be a niche. Even socks </p>
    <h3>Mind map</h3>
    <p>Write down anything you can think of. Products, audiences, anything...</p>
    <pre>Family -> Parents -> Mom -> Raising children -> Babies -> sleeping babies -> Blankets</pre>
    <p>As you go up the column the audience, content oportunity, money to be made and competition increases. As you go down it all decreases.
    </p>
    <p>A niche does not mean small.</p>
    <p>Pick something that has products that can be reviewed. And room to push supplmentary how to content. Seeding products with affiliate links in this content == money</p>

    <h2>Keyword research</h2>
    <p>http://nichehacks.com/survivalist-niche-seo-keyword-research/</p>
    <p>Add keywords to spreadsheet and check with googles keyword tool. How many are searching these keywords/month</p>
    <p>Keywords with 10 or so should be included in larger guides, while keywords with more searches would make a good whole article search topics.</p>
    <p>Go to google and find the competition. search e.g "best baby blankets. check out the top 10 sites. Can i do better? profit! if not skip and on to next keyword.</p>

      <h2>Hosting</h2>
      <p>Digital ocean good choice. 10$. can scale later</p>
      <p>For beginners shared or VPS hosting is recommended</p>
      <h2>SSL</h2>
      <p>letsencrypt.org gives free SSL. no reason not to use it. Seems more legit, couple with HTTP/2  for speed.</p>
      <p>I found https://bjornjohansen.no/enable-http2-on-nginx and https://ma.ttias.be/architecting-websites-http2-era/ helpful  http://caniuse.com/#search=http2.</p>

      <p>Also need social handles. Its your brand name. Facebook, twitter, instragram, pinterest, snapchat? Google+ etc.</p>
      <p>Check if names is open https://namechk.com/</p>
      <p>A good name for a kitchenware website could be a made up word like "zaletra.com" or a generic but relevant name like "fredskitchen.com".</p>
      <p>Avoid names like "bestblenders.com" - awful to brand, awkward when u want to expand offspring. OK if you want only one product</p>
      <p>the .com dosent matter,  could be anything. pick what you like</p>
      <h2>Webmaster and analytics</h2>

      <h3>One way to get backlinks. A story</h3>
      <pre>
        Well I was surprised to see this same level of fanaticism surrounding one of my products. If someone cares about something a lot, it’s not too hard to rustle his or her jimmies. So with this in mind I actually bought the highest model of this product, one that is particularly popular and gets exceptional feedback from its cult following, just to review it.

  And I absolutely roasted it. Not in a troll way. In a legitimate way. You should know that for every feature a product has, there is someone who is going to find it useless. I wrote the review from the mindset of someone who wouldn’t like or need every feature. It was scathing. I finished the review with something similar to “Do not buy this product, it is broken in it's current state” I then went on to recommend the competing brand.

  Pretty happy with my dirty work I now had to make my opinion known. So I posted it in one of the forums where the product was routinely praised. Boy, didn’t that open the floodgates….

  No my Akismet is working fine. This is the amount of responses I got on my article. Over the next 24 hours I received over 200 comments on the article itself. I also posted forums where the opposing fanboys lurked. In addition to this I reached out via social media and email to anyone who had reviewed the product, informing them of my findings and questioning their odd choice to praise the product. I also reached out people who reviewed the competing product and praised their decision to recommend it over the one I had reviewed, linking back.

  My article was being talked about. And posted. And argued about. Not just in the comment section of my website by right across the web. I had links to this post appear naturally in comment sections of big brand review sites, forums. Two influencers even amended their article to include my review as an alternate opinion. Not to mention all the social media shares.

  Now the product cost between $80 and $250. And out of that I got 32 backlinks (that I can find) pointing back to that one page of my website. Now while the majority are blog comments and forum posts there was some real juicy ones as well. But the juicy links only pointed to that one single page. It’s here that internal links come in. Linking to related articles from your link magnet helps give a boost to them in the eyes of google. It’s NOT instant. But it is noticeable. So I linked different reviews which in turn linked out to other reviews. Internal linking is a must, not just for google but for your user. If they are enjoying reading a review but the product isn’t right for them, recommend one that is. You may find this gains you a sale.
      </pre>
  <p>TLDR: Write a negative review about a product with many fanboys. Recommend the competition. Link to other reviewers to get mentioned as the same opinion. Link on forums where the fanboys are and ask why they think im wrong. PROFIT</p>

  <h2>Add more content</h2>
